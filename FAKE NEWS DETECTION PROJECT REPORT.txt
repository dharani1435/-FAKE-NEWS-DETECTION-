FAKE NEWS DETECTION PROJECT REPORT
1. Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that detects whether a given news article is Fake or True.
We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data from two datasets: Fake.csv and True.csv.

2. Dataset Details

Dataset Source:
The dataset contains two CSV files:

Fake.csv – Contains false or misleading news articles.

True.csv – Contains legitimate, verified news articles.

Key Columns:

title — Headline of the news article

text — Body of the news article

subject — Category or topic of the article

date — Date of publication

Each file is merged into a single dataset with a new column label:

0 → Fake News

1 → True News

3. Approach

Steps followed:

Import and explore the datasets using pandas.

Combine the two datasets and assign labels (0 for Fake, 1 for True).

Clean the text by:

Removing punctuation, numbers, and URLs

Converting all text to lowercase

Removing stop words and extra whitespace

Merge the title and text columns to create a single text feature.

Convert text data to numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Train a Logistic Regression model to classify news as Fake or True.

Evaluate model performance using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Visualize frequent words using WordClouds.

4. Key Code Snippets
# Load datasets
fake_df = pd.read_csv('Fake.csv')
true_df = pd.read_csv('True.csv')

# Label data
fake_df['label'] = 0
true_df['label'] = 1

# Combine and clean
df = pd.concat([fake_df, true_df])
df['text'] = df['title'] + " " + df['text']

# TF-IDF Vectorization and Model Training
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_df=0.7)
X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train)
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

5. Model Evaluation
| Metric               | Score |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| **Accuracy**         | 98.3% |
| **Precision (Fake)** | 0.98  |
| **Recall (Fake)**    | 0.97  |
| **F1-score (Fake)**  | 0.98  |
| **Precision (True)** | 0.98  |
| **Recall (True)**    | 0.99  |
| **F1-score (True)**  | 0.98  |

Confusion Matrix Interpretation:
The model performs consistently well across both classes with minimal misclassifications.

6. Visualization

Two WordClouds are generated:

One for Fake News

One for True News

These highlight the most frequent words appearing in each category.
For instance:

Fake news often uses emotional, sensational, or politically biased words.

True news focuses more on factual, neutral, and informative language.

7. Insights

Fake news articles often contain exaggerated or emotionally charged words.

True news emphasizes verified and evidence-based reporting.

Combining title and text significantly improves the model’s understanding.

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression provides a strong, interpretable baseline.

8. Future Scope

Implement BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT for advanced contextual text understanding.

Use metadata like author credibility, source reputation, and reader engagement.

Deploy the model as a Streamlit or Flask web app for real-time detection.

Integrate browser extensions or news APIs for live verification.

9. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can be leveraged to identify and classify fake news articles.
The developed model achieves high accuracy and serves as a strong baseline for further research and deployment.

By using techniques like TF-IDF and Logistic Regression, we establish a reliable foundation for combating misinformation through automated systems.

10. Sample Prediction
sample = ["Breaking: Scientists found aliens in Mars!"]
prediction = model.predict(tfidf.transform(sample))
# Output: Fake
